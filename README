# Gravity Jump Simulation

## Testing / Running Locally

1. Make sure you have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
2. From the project root, start a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
4. Interact with the planet selector, enter a mass value, and press the spacebar to trigger jumps. Observe how the jump height and weight display respond to the selected planet.

### Alternative: Open Directly
You can also double-click `index.html` to open the file directly in your browser. Some browsers block local file access for audio or advanced features, so use the local server approach above if anything appears missing.

## Tips
- Use the on-page reset button to return to Earth quickly if you want to compare different planets back-to-back.
- Adjust the mass input to see how weight scales while the jump animation still depends on gravity.
